# **Interesting libraries**
Here summared libraries which are interesting for me. 
* Mito: Do data analysis within seconds
  >Mito is a Python library that allows us to do data analysis within seconds. With Mito, we don’t need to remember all the methods and function that Pandas has, but we can work with a dataframe as if it was an Excel spreadsheet.
* SweetViz: Data visualization with one line of code
  >Sometimes we need to make a quick exploratory data analysis but we’re running out of time or don’t feel like writing code. In these situations, we can generate multiple visualizations using a Python library called sweetviz.With sweetviz, we can quickly build a report with beautiful visualizations to analyze each column in our dataset. The report is exported in an HTML file that we can find in our working directory.
* Faker: Generate fake data for your projects
 >Have you ever wanted to generate fake data to build your own dataset? In the past, I could easily generate random numbers with Numpy, but when I had to generate names, emails, and addresses, there wasn’t a simple solution … until I discovered the Faker library. This library helps us generate fake data for our projects. Data such as job, company, social security number, residence, birth date, and more can be easily generated with Faker.
*OpenDataset: Get datasets in your working directory with one line of code
 >If you ever follow tutorials and guides, you’ve probably downloaded dozens of Kaggle datasets to your computer. This means going to Kaggle, downloading the file, and dragging it to your working directory. This isn’t a big deal, but when you have to repeat these steps many times, it becomes tedious. Here OpenDataset can help. Instead of following all the steps mentioned before, you only install this Python library, import it and with one line of code, the dataset will be ready to use.
*Emoji: Turn emojis into text
 >If you ever had to extract data from social sites like Twitter, you know that you won’t only find plain text but also emojis that contain useful information. The problem is that we’d probably lose the emojis when extracting the tweet. For example, if someone tweets “Happy birthday! ❤️🎁“ and you extract that tweet, you’d miss the information inside the heart and gift emojis.
* PyForest: Import 40 python libraries with 1 line of code (good for personal projects)
 >How many times have you tried to use a method or function from a Python library just to realize you haven’t imported it yet? That used to happen to me very often, but now I sometimes use a library called PyForest that imports well-known Python libraries used for data analysis with just one line of code.

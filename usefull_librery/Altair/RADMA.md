#Altair 
Altair is a statistical visualization library for Python. 
It is not as popular as Seaborn or Matplotlib but I suggest 
you give Altair a chance as well.
What I like best about Altair is the filtering and data transformation operations. It provides many options to manipulate data while creating a visualization. In this sense, Altair can be considered as a more 
complete exploratory data tool.

# Streamlit
Streamlit recognizes that data science work is meant to be shared and understood by people outside of your data science team. Streamlit makes it possible to turn a Python script into a user friendly data app.

Here is their website - https://streamlit.io/

Streamlit makes it simple to add interactive widgets to any analysis.
To install Streamlit, run these commands:

pip install streamlit<br>
streamlit hello

They also make it easy to deploy your apps. Figuring out deployment can often be the most tedious part of creating a data app. All you have to do is select your repository, branch, and main file path, and Streamlit will deploy it.

Data science teams can often work insularly. Streamlit allows the team to focus on their analysis, but gives them the ability to share their analysis effectively without spending a lot of time on the sharing process.

This module implements specialized container datatypes providing alternatives 
to Pythonâ€™s general purpose built-in containers, dict, list, set, and tuple.

namedtuple()

factory function for creating tuple subclasses with named fields

deque

list-like container with fast appends and pops on either end

ChainMap

dict-like class for creating a single view of multiple mappings

Counter

dict subclass for counting hashable objects

OrderedDict

dict subclass that remembers the order entries were added

defaultdict

dict subclass that calls a factory function to supply missing values

UserDict

wrapper around dictionary objects for easier dict subclassing

UserList

wrapper around list objects for easier list subclassing

UserString

wrapper around string objects for easier string subclassing

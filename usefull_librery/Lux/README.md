# Lux
Lux is a great tool for data visualization and exploratory data analysis. Lux will take any data frame and automatically recommend visualizations that help you explore and share the data. You do not need to write any of the visualization code yourself.<br><br>

To import lux:

import lux
import pandas as pd

Below you can see how Lux provides visualization options for any data frame. All you need to do is select the chart you want. No coding required. This is a huge time saver, as getting the exact correct syntax from a package from like matplotlib or seaborn can be time intensive.

Lux allows you to export your visualizations as well, making the sharing process smooth and simple. You can export the visualizations to HTML, or you can convert them into the equivalent matplotlib code, so you can edit them further.
